First you have to copy related `bnbcli`(for mainnet) and `tbnbcli`(for testnet) to this directory.

Then you can execute the specific script you want.

1. `issue.sh` will instruct you to issue token on `testnet` or `mainnet`.
2. `propose.sh` will instruct you to create a listing proposal on `testnet` or `mainnet`.
